## Simulated single-Cell Omics with Realistic Phenotypes and Integrated Outcomes

Simulation strategy for single-cell clusters with differential abundance between groups. This approach generates single-cell datasets along with corresponding metadataâ€”including disease status, cell type, subject, batch, as well as age and sex. This code has been adapted from [Dr. Jun Inamo's simulation code](https://github.com/juninamo/S2EQTL).

## Usage
Run the `simulation_benchmark.sh` script to automize the generation of the datasets.
For example, 
```bash
$ cd src
$ bash simulation_benchmark.sh
```
